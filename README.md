## Specifications

This is a rebase fork of `tootsuite/mastodon`, all local changes are rebased on the top. To pull the latest commits of this repo, use `git reset --hard origin/master` instead of `git pull`.

To enable the new custom features, please add the necessary configurations first according to the file end of `.env.production.sample`.

The translation backend is [here](https://github.com/mashirozx/google-translate-server) and the Docker image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mashirozx/google-translate-server), see `docker-compose.yml`.

**This project added the Chinese words segmentation support in Elasticsearch, please use this [Elasticsearch image](https://github.com/mashirozx/elasticsearch-cnplugin). Using the original version of Elasticsearch Engine may goes into error.**

## Finally

Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on ActivityPub where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon software that implements ActivityPub)!

## Features

<img src="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/elephant.svg" align="right" width="30%" />

### No vendor lock-in: Fully interoperable with any conforming platform

It doesn't have to be Mastodon; whatever implements ActivityPub is part of the social network! [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/)

### Real-time, chronological timeline updates

Updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!

### Media attachments like images and short videos

Upload and view images and WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like GIFs; normal videos loop continuously!

### Safety and moderation tools

Mastodon includes private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting, blocking and all sorts of other features, along with a reporting and moderation system. [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/)

### OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API

Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider, so 3rd party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs. This results in a rich app ecosystem with a lot of choices!

## Deployment

### Tech stack:

- **Ruby on Rails** powers the REST API and other web pages
- **React.js** and Redux are used for the dynamic parts of the interface
- **Node.js** powers the streaming API

### Requirements:

- **PostgreSQL** 9.5+
- **Redis** 4+
- **Ruby** 2.5+
- **Node.js** 12+

The repository includes deployment configurations for **Docker and docker-compose** as well as specific platforms like **Heroku**, **Scalingo**, and **Nanobox**. The [**standalone** installation guide](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/install/) is available in the documentation.

A **Vagrant** configuration is included for development purposes. To use it, complete following steps:

- Install Vagrant and Virtualbox
- Install the `vagrant-hostsupdater` plugin: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
- Run `vagrant up`
- Run `vagrant ssh -c "cd /vagrant && foreman start"`
- Open `http://mastodon.local` in your browser
